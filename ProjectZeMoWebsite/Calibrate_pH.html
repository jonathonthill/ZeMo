    <h3>pH Calibration:</h3>
    <p> Choose between the single point, two point, or three point calibration. </p>
    <h4>Single Point Calibration:</h4>
    <p>
        Press the &ldquo;Single-pt&rdquo; button.
        <br />Enter the pH level for the midPt. Should be 7.
        <br />Press the &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button.
        <br />Remove the cap and rinse the probe.
        <br />Pour a small amount of solution in the cup.
        <br />Place the probe in the solution for 1-2 minutes.
        <br />Press the &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button.
        <br />Do not pour solution back in solution bottle.
        <br />The screen should show &ldquo;Calibration Successful&rdquo; and you will be returned to the main screen for pH.
        If it did not then retry the calibration.
    </p>
    <h4>Two Point Calibration:</h4>
    <p>Press the &ldquo;Two-pt&rdquo; button.
    <br />Enter the pH level for the mid point. Should be 7.
    <br />Press the &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button.
    <br />Remove the cap and rinse the probe.
    <br />Pour a small amount of mid point solution in the cup.
    <br />Place the probe in the solution for 1-2 minutes.
    <br />Press the &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button.
    <br />Do not pour solution back in solution bottle.
    <br />The screen should show &ldquo;Calibration Successful&rdquo;. If it did not then retry the calibration.
    <br />Enter the pH level for the low point. Should be lower than 7.
    <br />Press the &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button.
    <br />Pour a small amount of low point solution in the cup.
    <br />Place the probe in the solution for 1-2 minutes.
    <br />Press the &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button.
    <br />Do not pour solution back in solution bottle.
    <br />The screen should show &ldquo;Calibration Successful&rdquo; and you will be returned to the main screen for pH.
    If it did not then retry the calibration.</p>
    <h4>Three Point Calibration:</h4>
    <p>
        Press the &ldquo;Three-pt&rdquo; button.
        <br />Enter the pH level for the mid point. Should be 7.
        <br />Press the &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button.
        <br />Remove the cap and rinse the probe.
        <br />Pour a small amount of mid point solution in the cup.
        <br />Place the probe in the solution for 1-2 minutes.
        <br />Press the &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button.
        <br />Do not pour solution back in solution bottle.
        <br />The screen should show &ldquo;Calibration Successful&rdquo;. If it did not then retry the calibration.
        <br />Enter the pH level for the low point. Should be lower than 7.
        <br />Press the &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button.
        <br />Pour a small amount of low point solution in the cup.
        <br />Place the probe in the solution for 1-2 minutes.
        <br />Press the &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button.
        <br />Do not pour solution back in solution bottle.
        <br />The screen should show &ldquo;Calibration Successful&rdquo;. If it did not then retry the calibration.
        <br />Enter the pH level for the high point. Should be higher than 7.
        <br />Press the &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button.
        <br />Pour a small amount of high point solution in the cup.
        <br />Place the probe in the solution for 1-2 minutes.
        <br />Press the &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button.
        <br />Do not pour solution back in solution bottle.
        <br />The screen should show &ldquo;Calibration Successful&rdquo; and you will be returned to the main screen for pH.
        If it did not then retry the calibration.
