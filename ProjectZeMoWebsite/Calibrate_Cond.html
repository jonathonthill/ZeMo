    <h3>Calibrate Conductivity Probe:</h3>
    <p>
        Press the &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button.
        <br />Dry off the conductivity probe.
        <br />Press the &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button and wait. If the screen should flash a &ldquo;Calibration Successful&rdquo; you have
        successfully done the dry calibration portion. If it did not, then retry the calibration.
        <br />Place the probe in the conductivity solution, and stir it to remove trapped air.
        <br />Press the &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button and wait.
        <br />The probe will take readings until it gets within a 40% variance of the solution for two consecutive readings. It will then
        calibrate the probe, and you should see a &ldquo;Calibration Successful&rdquo; blip and be returned to the main screen for Conductivity.
        If it did not then retry the calibration.
