    <h2>Project ZēMō</h2>
    <p>
        Project ZēMō is an open source zebrafish monitoring system. Using a raspberry pi, this monitor takes continuous reads. A
        touchscreen interface is used to adjust out of range values, take manual reads, calibrate the probes, and change the number
        of reads taken every day. One may also update range values, people on the email list, and the reads taken per day via a website.
